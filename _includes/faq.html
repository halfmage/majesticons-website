                    <p class="mb-2">Inconsistency in icons is the most noticeable flaw in contemporary UI design. Although countless icon libraries exist online today, the majority of them suffer from issues such as poor quality, bugs, excessive stylization, or inadequate size—often a combination of these problems.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">The true value of a consistent icon library only becomes apparent when you actually use one. A reliable icon library saves you both time and money that would otherwise be spent on meticulously crafting icons individually or, even worse, constantly fixing existing icons to achieve consistency and visual balance.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">To assess the worth of an icon library, a useful perspective is to ask yourself, "Will this library save me several hours of work on a project?" If the answer is yes, then it's likely a worthwhile investment. Moreover, it transforms into an asset that can be utilized across countless future projects.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2">The beauty of this icon library lies in its unlimited usage across multiple projects. In fact, we purposefully designed it this way—Untitled UI Icons are built to be 100% native to Figma, providing consistency, professional quality, and a neutral aesthetic suitable for any UI or web design endeavor.</p>
